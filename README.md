# LP Music Caps Model Documentation

This repository contains a music captioning model based on the LP-MusicCaps framework. The model can generate textual descriptions of audio content, particularly music.

## Overview

LP Music Caps is a model that uses BART for caption generation and a specialized audio encoder for processing music files. The system processes audio files by splitting them into 10-second chunks, encoding each chunk, and generating captions for each segment.

## Files Structure

- **app.py**: Main application script that handles command-line arguments, audio processing, model loading, and caption generation.
- **audio_utils.py**: Utility functions for audio processing, including loading, resampling, and format conversion.
- **bart.py**: Contains the `BartCaptionModel` class which integrates the audio encoder with the BART model for caption generation.
- **modules.py**: Houses the audio processing components, including `MelEncoder` and `AudioEncoder`.

## Components

### app.py

The main script that orchestrates the captioning process:
- Parses command-line arguments
- Downloads model weights if needed
- Processes audio files into chunks
- Generates captions using the model
- Saves captions to a text file
- Optionally visualizes audio waveforms

### audio_utils.py

Contains utilities for audio handling:
- Audio loading with multiple fallback options (ffmpeg, librosa, soundfile)
- Channel format conversion
- Resampling functionality
- Noise generation utilities for testing

### bart.py

Implements the caption generation model:
- Integrates pre-trained BART model with custom audio encoder
- Handles tokenization and embedding
- Provides methods for caption generation using beam search or nucleus sampling

### modules.py

Contains neural network modules for audio processing:
- `MelEncoder`: Converts audio waveforms to mel spectrograms
- `AudioEncoder`: Processes mel spectrograms through convolutional layers and adds positional embeddings
- Provides utility functions for sinusoidal positional embeddings

## Usage
just run these commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python app.py --audio path/to/audio.mp3
```

### Options

- `--audio`, `-a`: Path to the audio file (default: "vocal+music.wav")
- `--max_length`: Maximum caption length (default: 128)
- `--num_beams`: Number of beams for generation (default: 5)
- `--visualize`, `-v`: Visualize audio waveform
- `--no_save_chunks`: Do not save audio chunks
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode with more verbose output

## API Implementation Suggestions

To create an API for this model, consider the following approach:

1. **Create a Flask/FastAPI server(maybe use celery or anything else)**:
   - Develop a RESTful API with endpoints for audio upload and caption generation
   - Include options for streaming response for long files

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/upload` - POST endpoint for audio file upload
   - `/caption` - GET endpoint that returns captions for previously uploaded file
   - `/caption_streaming` - Streaming endpoint for real-time captioning

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement authentication for API access
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Create a configuration endpoint to adjust model parameters

4. **Architecture**:
   - Use a queue system for processing longer files
   - Implement caching for previously processed audio
   - Add a file storage solution for temporary audio files

5. **Required Files**:
   - `api.py` - Main API implementation
   - `config.py` - Configuration settings
   - `middleware.py` - Authentication and rate limiting
   - `storage.py` - File handling utilities

## File Responsibilities

- **app.py**: CLI interface and orchestration logic
- **audio_utils.py**: Audio processing utilities that handle different audio formats and conversions
- **bart.py**: Implements the caption generation model using BART architecture
- **modules.py**: Contains neural components for audio feature extraction

This model processes audio in three main stages:
1. Audio is converted to mel spectrograms using `MelEncoder`
2. The spectrogram features are processed by `AudioEncoder`
3. The encoded audio is passed to the BART model to generate captions

The system is particularly useful for generating descriptive captions for music, which can be used for content accessibility, music library organization, or creative applications.
